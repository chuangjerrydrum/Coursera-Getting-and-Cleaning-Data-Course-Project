# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

This project contains:

1.README.md, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.

2.CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

3.run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by 
just importing the file.

4.data_summary.txt, which contains the output of final tidy data set.

Step for creating dataset:

[Step 0A - Get data]

[Step 0B - Set working directory and Read data]

[Step 1 - Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set]

[Step 2 - Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement]

[Step 3 - Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set]

[Step 4 - Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names]

[Step 5 - Create a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject]
