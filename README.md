# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones 

1.README.md, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.

2.CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

3.run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by 
just importing the file.

4.data_summary.txt, which contains the output of final tidy data set.

Step for creating dataset:

[STEP 0A - Get data]

[STEP 0B - Set working directory and Read data]

[Step 1 - Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set]

[Step 2 - Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement]

[Step 3 - Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set]

[Step 4 - Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names]

[Step 5 - Create a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject]
